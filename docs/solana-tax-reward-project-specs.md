# Solana Token Buy/Sell Tax and Full SOL Reward Redistribution Contract - Technical Specifications

## Project Overview

This project implements a Solana smart contract (program) for an SPL token that applies a 5% tax on both buy and sell transactions. All collected taxes are fully swapped into SOL and immediately redistributed as rewards proportionally to all token holders without delay to ensure a complete "2/2" reward sharing cycle that is both transparent and efficient.

## Development Environment Setup

- Install Rust (latest stable)
- Install Solana Tool Suite (https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- (Optional) Install Anchor framework for simplified Solana development
- Set up a local Solana test validator for fast iteration (`solana-test-validator`)
- Use VSCode or preferred IDE with Rust extensions
- Install solana-program library for on-chain development

## Architectural Design

### Contract Logic

- **Buy/Sell Detection:**  
  Identify buy and sell transactions by analyzing the instruction context or interaction with liquidity pools (DEX).

- **Tax Application and Immediate Swap:**  
  Apply a 5% tax on buys and sells, immediately swap the collected tokens for SOL via DEX CPI calls.

- **Full Reward Redistribution:**  
  Distribute the swapped SOL rewards proportionally and immediately to all token holders based on their token ownership at transaction time.

- **Real-Time Holder Tracking:**  
  Maintain real-time state of holders’ balances for accurate proportional reward allocation during each transaction.

### Program State

- Holder State: Tracks each holder’s token balance and pending rewards.
- Reward Pool Account: Holds SOL ready for immediate distribution.
- No intermediate accumulation: Taxes are swapped and distributed instantly.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for tax calculation, immediate token swap, and reward distribution per transaction.
- Integration tests on `solana-test-validator` validating immediate SOL redistribution correctness on buy/sell.
- Security tests ensuring no reentrancy and safe SOL transfers.

## Deployment Process

- Deploy on Solana Devnet initially, with CLI or Anchor deployment.
- Conduct load and functional testing on Devnet.
- Deploy securely to Mainnet ensuring upgrade authority control.
- Integrate CI/CD for build, test, and deploy pipelines.

## Security and Best Practices

- Adhere to Solana best security practices.
- Audit external DEX CPI interactions thoroughly.
- Minimize on-chain computation for cost efficiency.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Manage upgrade authority and pause controls carefully.

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- Monitor logs and reward distribution metrics.
- Track SOL balances and token holder reward correctness.
- Set alerts for failures, anomalies.
- Prepare scripts for configurable parameters (tax rates, pause, etc).


This specification fully reflects the "2/2" plan to immediately convert and redistribute all collected taxes as SOL rewards to token holders, ensuring fairness, transparency, and timeliness in reward sharing.
